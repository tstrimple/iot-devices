This project builds on and extends the following key differentiators of Windows IoT Core:\r\n\r\n- Runs Windows 10 apps written in C#, VB, C++, JavaScript and more\r\n- Provides a Rich UI and Input Stack\r\n- Offers a familiar Model  Event-Driven for App Developers\r\n \r\nCurrently this project offers the following benefits above and beyond what ships with Windows IoT Core:\r\n\r\n- Event-Driven pattern for using many Digital and Analog sensors\r\n- Specialized wrappers for niche devices like joystick and rotary encoder\r\n- Supports building custom wrappers for other  specialized devices\r\n- WinCore implementation of multiple ADC chips \r\n- Easily support more than one ADC chip in a single solution\r\n- XAML projection to onboard LCD displays\r\n\r\nOther features planned:\r\n\r\n- ISwitchable (e.g. Relay) support\r\n- PWM hardware and software implementations\r\n- DAC support\r\n- OneWire support\r\n- More specialized wrappers\r\n\r\n## Follow Along ##\r\nYou can follow this project as it develops including new labs and articles on [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/team-devices-for-windows-iot/devices-for-windows-iot \"hackster.io\")","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
